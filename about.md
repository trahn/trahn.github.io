###Hi there!

Glad you made it to my blog. :smile:

This is kind of an experiment. I liked the idea of blogging for a while now and am currently surrounded by - mostly travel - bloggers. That and being lazy on other projects I want to pursue made me start this blog now (November 2014). 

Currently I am living in Chiang Mai, trying to get some healthy habits down, learning some web development with Ruby on Rails, and still having to write a Master's thesis at some point soon.

I have been traveling on and off for more than a year now. In this time I have been to (in order) Brazil, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Miami, India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Hong Kong, and now Thailand. In between I have been at home in Germany and in Switzerland. Summers in Germany are totally fine. :smile:

Switzerland, since I used to live there for about 6 years. I studied business, economics, and finance stuff at the University of St. Gallen, and have been living and working in finance in Zurich for about 2 years. I did derivative structuring / financial engineering for a Swiss bank there. My masters is in 'Quantitative Economics and Finance' and awaits completion. :smile:

On this blog I plan to write about anything that interests me at the time and that I find worth writing about. At the moment I am thinking of writing about culture and travel related topics, coding and personal projects/ideas I am working on, life in general, education, work, and maybe some politics. As you see my blog's topics are likely to be quite broad in scope.

Cheers
Till
