> Life is fucking fragile.

People die all the time. Life can be over quicker then you think.

> A smile goes a long fucking way.

I especially noticed that traveling around the world. If you are friendly, people tend to treat you friendly as well - wherever you are.

> It is ALL in your fucking mind.

Be it pain, convictions, or anything really. It is all in your mind and that does not necessarily make it real objectively.

> Fucking face it: life is inherently meaningless and you are going to die.

The realization that there is no predefined meaning for your life and that you are going to be dead not too far from now - in the great scheme of things - enables you to do whatever the fuck you want - almost. :smile:

> The more you fucking swear the more honest you tend to be. 

I read that in an article about the findings of some study and am using it to justify the use of swearwords herein. :smile:
