title: Motivation to Learn to Code
---

I have been learning web development with Ruby on Rails for about 4 months now. Lately, I haven't really kept up my pace though. I am kind of in a ditch. I need some motivation!

I have been following an online tutorial ([The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com), which I really recommend and will write about in more depth in another post) quite thoroughly. I guess I was mainly motivated by projects I had in my mind that I wanted to pursue with the acquired skills. Now I am at a point where I could actually start going forward with one of those personal project. And I guess change is scary, so I keep postponing.

Nevertheless, I have decided to start working on a project during the month of December now. Kind of like "a-project-a-month"-thing. 

Find below two videos that I like watching for motivational purposes. The first is a US-initiative to get more people into coding. It talks about the inherent creativity of coding, the scalability of ideas, and the need for developers in today's economy:

The other one is Mattan Griffel telling his story of learning Rails in a month and giving advice on not only how to go about learning, but also about reasons to, and motivation as an entrepreneur (or wannapreneur):
