Culture - that intangible set of customs, habits, convictions, and behaviors that are common to people belonging to a certain <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/seth_godin_on_the_tribes_we_lead" target="_blank">"tribe"</a> - and its implications cross my thoughts from time to time. Traveling you really notice all these differences. And it gets you thinking. You realize your own customary beliefs and habits and start reflecting on them. What actually is right? What makes sense - to do and to think?

## Realizing Culture

You realize your own culture when you are in contact with people from other cultures. Suddenly, there are subtle differences in behaviors or thinking between you. This doesn't only apply to people from different nations or regions, but rather along all lines that allow for different affiliations: be it generational, professional, or along the lines of some hobby. All of those allow for particular patterns of thought or behavior.

Having been on exchange in Singapore in 05, I noticed, for example, how Singaporeans don't blow their noses with a tissue like we do in "the West", but rather sniff it up their noses. I have been taught as kid, that you don't do that - because the snot would go into your brain. :smile: This practice seems rather disgusting to me now. Because I am not used to it. I can only imagine, that blowing ones nose in a tissue is quite disgusting to people in Singapore - or other parts of South-East-Asia. 

Another thing is whipping your butt with toilet paper vs. cleaning it with water and your hand - as they mostly do in India. I have never done the ladder and it seems quite revolting to me, but I recently read an answer on Quora by an Indian raising the valid point: "If you had poo on any other part of your body, would you wipe it off with a paper towel or clean it off with water?"

You might think that part of a good life is a proper and big Western-style kitchen. Don't look down on people preparing their meals in rather simple equipment on their floor. It is just a different way of doing things. Neither one, nor the other is inherently better. And if you have a rather false sense of pity towards people cooking their meals in such a simple way - let it be in India, for example - all I hear is: "My way of living, - cooking in this case - to which I have nothing contributed myself, but that is all inherited, is better then yours and that is why I - should - pity you."

Looking at it historically, men has been preparing meals on their floors far, far longer then in a made up Western-style kitchen. Modern men has been around for about 200,000 years. There have been quite many different ways of life over time; lives along very different circumstances and also very different cultures, if you will. I think it can only be described as presumptuous, if you think the way of life you are taught or that you inherited in this particular day and age - or even decided to live yourself - is the *correct* one. (I have found looking at things historically over the broadness of history quite helpful in many regards.)

## Make Up Your Own Culture

All these behavioral and thinking patterns should be recognized for what they are: often inherited and influenced by the people and societies or tribes you surround yourself with. Rather than fixed, they can be changed over time and are highly dependent on where and how you live. On top they depend on how aware you are about them.

I urge people to get aware of their particular - often inherited - patterns. You need to recognize them in order to reflect on them and think about their validity. Only then are they open for change.

In the end you can effectively make up your own culture by more pro-actively choosing the cultural norms you adhere to, those you don't, and make up those that make sense to yourself.
