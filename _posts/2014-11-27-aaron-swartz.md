On January 11, 2013, a 26-year-old was found dead in his apartment in New York. His name was Aaron Swartz and he committed suicide in wake of facing a prison sentence of up to 35 years and a fine of up to one million dollar. Before telling his story and elaborating on it, let us first look at the initial proposition that led me to talk about him.

##The Good Old Days
In one or the other form one often hears the opinion *"that younger generations, as individualistic as they are, tend to settle for a highly streamlined social and economic world that does not ask for big decisions or unconventional thinking."<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sub></a>* While this observation might be true, the emphasis should be on the word *tend*. Certainly, the majority of the young somehow fall into the outlined category. Nevertheless, I do not think that this holds true only for current times, but rather has been this way ever since: the majority of the people follow the well worn path and only some few step of the path, challenge the status-quo, and eventually shape the future.

The attitude that resonates in the statement above is one of romanticization of the past. Of course, in hindsight everything was better then than it is now: people were more involved, were engaged in politics, grew businesses, and helped each other out; where nowadays the youth just spends its time in front of TV, computer, and smartphone with no focus on school or doing chores at home but rather only looking for their own pleasure. But this is more of a generational conflict than it is a totally new phenomenon. Old people, fifty years ago, likely complained about the youth back then, who now does the same. This observation seems to stem from changing challenges and different environments - and the perception thereof - over time, and not from a becoming lazy or whatsoever of the youth. 

There are many current examples that underpin the involvement of young generations. Maybe not so much in areas that seem important to current older generations, but rather in areas that seem important to them, and are brought about by changing environments - the internet being one big transitional factor. One could talk about Mark Zuckerberg for example: the now 28-year-old billionaire who invented Facebook, that not only shaped and changed modern communication and socializing, but also helped giving a voice to people all over the world that formerly had none, and maybe even helped democratize the world in a sense when looking at its role in the only very recent Arab Spring. But I will not talk about him or any other  similar success stories that underline the involvement of young generations. 

##Aaron Swartz: Innovator, Idealist, Activist<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sub></a>

Instead I want to talk about Aaron Swartz - a less known figure. I did not know him myself up until recently, when his death made the headlines of mass media. Aaron has been described as a kid genius (Lessig, 2013, January 12), as he has been a talented programmer from young age, involved in the development of the first version of the popular RSS feed at age 14, and other projects before and after. Later, after attending Stanford for a year, he founded the company Infogami that soon merged with Reddit, the now very popular social news website. Aaron was an equal partner in Reddit, but was later let go when Reddit was acquired. After launching another startup he became a fellow at the Center for Ethics at Harvard.
I want to focus on two areas of Aaron's involvement: first, the bringing down of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), and second, his quest of giving access to knowledge to everybody in the JSTOR case.

##SOPA: Ensuring Internet Freedom
Introduced in late 2011, SOPA sought to enable the US government to shut down websites in case of copyright infringements in light of the availability of the latest movies and TV-shows on the internet. There quickly formed a protest movement against the bill, which was sponsored by the movie industry. Aaron was at the heart of this movement.

As a keynote speaker at the *Freedom to Connect* conference 2012 Aaron told the story of the rise and eventual downfall of SOPA: the bill was supposed to be passed by the US congress quickly, with majority support, and without much notice. The latter did not quite work out as there quickly formed resistance against it, mainly on the internet. What looked as a sure thing eventually turned out a failure for the supporters of the bill. 

The main critique Aaron, his activist group *Demand Progress*, and others brought forth, was that the bill essentially gave the US government the power to censor the internet and thereby deprive Americans of the *freedom to connect* - what they thought to be a violation of the first amendment. As part of the protest movement many well known, daily used websites tried to raise awareness of SOPA by e.g. turning off their services for a day. 

By informing the public and organizing resistance, Aaron thus was at the core of overturning SOPA, which is an amazing achievement for a then 25-year-old - especially considering that, starting out, the bill had that much support among congress. Aaron ended the above mentioned keynote speech with an appeal to everyone (Swartz, 2012, May 21):

> The senators were right: The Internet really is out of control. But if we forget that, if we let Hollywood rewrite the story so it was just big company Google who stopped the bill, if we let them persuade us we didn't actually make a difference and we start seeing it as someone else's responsibility to do this work, and it's our job just to go home and pop some popcorn and curl up on the couch to watch Transformers, well, then next time they might just win. Let's not let that happen. 


##JSTOR: Democratizing Knowledge
To most of the academic world JSTOR will be known: it is a digital library of journal articles and other sources. And it charges quite heavy fees for access to its database - a fact that disturbed Aaron. After all, the knowledge in these articles was generated by scholars at public expense. And not even the scholars profited from their work, but rather only the publishing companies.

Aaron took action by writing a computer program that allowed for automatic downloading of these articles from JSTOR. After his first attempt at Harvard and the following disconnection of his account by JSTOR, he used the *open campus* platform of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to access JSTOR. He placed a laptop in one of MIT's servers that kept downloading JSTOR articles by continuously faking a different identity of the accessing computer. But Aaron never got to making the articles available to the public as he was arrested before, but eventually got out on bail.

JSTOR was not interested in legally pursuing this violation of its terms and services any further and actually opened up more in consequence: shortly before Aaron's death it announced that it would make available a certain amount of articles online for free. MIT's stance in the matter was not that clear. The federal prosecutors nevertheless went forward with their case. The trial was set to start in April. Aaron committed suicide on January 11 of this year. Obviously, we can not fully understand what caused him to go this final step, but one must add that he was battling depressions also. The outcry on the internet and in the media was enormous after his death. The speculations around the cause and the role of the federal prosecution has been much discussed since. Gleen Greenwald (2013, January 12) wrote for *The Guardian* about his view on the case:

> Swartz's activism, I argued, was waged as part of one of the most vigorously contested battles - namely, the war over how the internet is used and who controls the information that flows on it - and that was his real crime in the eyes of the US government: challenging its authority and those of corporate factions to maintain a stranglehold on that information.

I have recently watched the film *Cloud Atlas* where one of the main characters commits suicide after writing to his lover: *"A true suicide is a paced, disciplined certainty. People pontificate suicide is a coward's act. Couldn't be further from the truth. Suicide takes tremendous courage."* This shall certainly not glorify committing suicide but rather gives an insight into what must have gone on in Aaron's mind. To be certain that the only way out is death reflects the situation he saw himself in. 

##So What Can We Learn?

Aaron did not shy away from bold action and tried to accomplish his ideals - even against the US legislative, the movie industry, and powerful publishing companies. And all that for what he thought right, not for any financial gain, power, or status - or as Harvard professor and close friend of Aaron, Lawrence Lessig (2013, January 12), put it in his blog:

> Aaron had literally done nothing in his life to make money. [...] Aaron was always and only working for (at least his conception of) the public good.

Sure, one can always argue that it was only *his* perception of the common good and that it does not give him the right to push through rigorously what he thinks right. But when looking at these, *his*, ideals, I - and I am sure many others - can only subscribe to them: for freedom and access to knowledge, and against government censorship - basic pillars of democracy.

I chose the title *United Stated v. Aaron Swartz* - the official case in the JSTOR prosecution - as it emphasizes the somewhat unequal battle on the one hand, and the conflict between government control and freedom in general on the other. Aaron certainly was acting against the current - in his case: legislators, Hollywood executives, and strong publishing companies - which makes the battle even more tough. The area of conflict between freedom and government control is an important and always existing one - raising the question: how much freedom should people give up in the hands of the government? I, for one, like to have as much freedom as possible as I would rather make my own choices than have somebody else make them for me. After all, the battle for this personal freedom has been a long one historically.

The story of Aaron Swartz gives rise to the question of what changes are necessary to foster an environment where courage like his is actually first enabled, and second rewarded? One could think of trying to reform incentives for courage in society - be it in the field of education, taxation, or any other - or of reorganizing institutions to allow for more individuality. But in the end, these can only facilitate courage. Courage itself has to come from within, or as Aaron put it in a 2010 interview when asked about the source of his drive (Swartz, 2010, January): 

> I feel very strongly that it's not enough to just live in the world as it is, to just take what you're given and follow the things that adults told you to do and that your parents told you to do and the society tells you to do. I think that you should always be questioning. I take this very scientific attitude that everything you've learned is just provisional that it's always open to recantation or refutation or questioning and I think the same applies to society. [...]

> So because I had believed for so long that change was impossible it precluded me from taking any actions that could have caused that change and so I think the first step for everyone out there is to believe that you can actually accomplish something because once you believe that you're half way to actually doing something.

### Footnotes
<p id="fn1">[1] As taken from the essay task.</p>
<p id="fn2">[2] The facts are mainly based on the English Wikipedia article on Aaron Swartz, but also from other sources where indicated. In light of the topics freedom of the internet and the common availability of knowledge that Aaron was, among others, fighting for, this source seems appropriate. Also Wikipedia is found to be quite reliable in various studies.</p>
