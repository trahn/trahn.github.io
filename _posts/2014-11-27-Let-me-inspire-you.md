title: Let me inspire you!
---

There is something about some inspiring speeches that gets to me. I find myself watching them time and again. I guess they often contain lessons or ideas that I want to - or already do - incorporate in my own life.


Let me show you right here -  and for the first time publicly :grin: - the speeches that I keep coming back to. All happen to be commencement speeches, which somewhat makes sense as the idea often is to pass on some learned wisdom to the next generation. 

These are my all time favorites (currently :wink:):

## Jobs on Life, Death and Purpose

This one is kind of a classic and does not need much introduction. Most of you have probably seen it before.

## J.K. Rowling on Failure and the Power of Imagination

Before I saw her commencement speech I did not know J.K. Rowling was such an inspiring and deep person. Knowing her background a little from media I was aware she must be rather down-to-earth, but this speech really makes me like her.

## Tim Minchin humorously on all Kinds of Stuff

I love Tim Minchin's stuff. A lot of wisdom and all packaged up in a funny way. If you like this talk check out his musical comedy as well.
